============================

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- :py:meth:`evaluate <opencosmo.Dataset.evaluate>` no longer broadcasts array keyword arguments that have the same length as the dataset. You can still use arrays in this way by setting :code:`vectorize = True` or first inserting the array as a new column with :py:meth:`with_new_columns <opencosmo.Dataset.with_new_columns>`


opencosmo 1.2.2 (2026-03-23)
============================

Bugfixes
--------

opencosmo 1.2.1 (2026-03-23)
============================

Bugfixes
--------

- Fix a bug that prevented documentation for new versions from being rendered on readthedocs


opencosmo 1.2.0 (2026-03-23)
============================

Bugfixes
--------

- Fix a bug that could cause evaluation verification to fail because of unit checks
- Fix a bug that could cause spatial queries to fail if there were no objects in the parts of the spatial index that
  partially intersect with the query region.
- Units are converted to comoving in :py:class:`halo_projection_array <opencosmo.analysis.halo_projection_array>`
  :py:meth:`create_yt_dataset <opencosmo.analysis.create_yt_dataset>` raises an error if the inputted dataset has factors of "littleh" in the units
  converting yt field keys to tuple in :py:class:`halo_projection_array <opencomo.analysis.halo_projection_array>`.


New Features
------------

- Add :py:meth:`box_search <opencosmo.Lightcone.box_search>` to the Lightcone API for performing
  spatial regions in a given RA and Dec range. (feature)
- - :py:class:`halo_projection_array <opencosmo.analysis.halo_projection_array>` visualizations now support empty panels.
  - Added ``cmap_norm`` and ``cmap_norms`` parameters to :py:class:`halo_projection_array <opencosmo.analysis.halo_projection_array>`
  - Changed the default text label color to `"lightgray"` (998e1c5)
- :py:meth:`select <opencosmo.Dataset.select>` and :py:meth:`drop <opencosmo.Dataset.drop>` now accept wildcards.
- :py:meth:`select <opencosmo.Dataset.select>` no longer requires column names to be passed as a list or tuple.
- :py:meth:`select <opencosmo.Dataset.select>` now support passing derived columns as keyhword arguments, which are instantiated as part of the selection.
- :py:meth:`with_new_columns <opencosmo.Dataset.with_new_columns>` now accept simple columns created with :py:meth:`oc.col <opencosmo.col>`, effectively allowing for renaming.
- Datasets now support accessing column units with the :py:attr:`.units <opencosmo.Dataset.units>` attribute.
- Introduce a :py:func:`make_skybox <opencosmo.make_skybox>` function for creating boxes with RA and Dec ranges for
  performing spatial queries on lightcone data.
- Lightcones now automatically create a :code:`ra` and :code:`dec` column if they do not exist but can be derived from the existing columns.


Improvements
------------

- :py:meth:`StructureCollection.with_datasets <opencosmo.StructureCollection.with_datasets>` now accepts any iterable rather than just lists.
- Headers are now no longer as strict about what groups are required, assuring non-hacc datasets can be used without modifying the available parameter models.
- Python 3.14 is now tested in CI and fully supported
- The :py:meth:`open <opencosmo.open>` function has been rewritten to be more systematic, and significant internal documentation has been added to provide context around the decision making process.


Miscellaneous
-------------

- The :code:`output` parameter in :py:meth:`Dataset.get_data <opencosmo.Dataset.get_data>` has been renamed to :code:`format`. The method will continue to accept :code:`output` as a keyword argument for the time being, but will print a deprecation warning.

- The logic behind :py:meth:`oc.write <opencosmo.write>` has been completely rewritten to be more functional, reliable, and easy to extend. This change does not affect how the function is used, and does not make any changes to the data format.
- Writing in an MPI context will now fail with an error if no rank has data to write
